## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 18.x or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd gemini-content-forge
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. **It is crucial to configure these correctly for the application to function.**

    ```env
    # For Google Custom Search API & Genkit (Gemini Models)
    # IMPORTANT:
    # - GOOGLE_API_KEY and CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID are read by Genkit on the server-side.
    # - NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID are used by the Next.js
    #   frontend *only* to display warnings if these keys seem unconfigured.
    #   The actual API calls for search are made server-side.
    # Ensure your Google API Key has "Custom Search API" and "Vertex AI API"
    # (or "Generative Language API" if using older Gemini models directly) enabled in the Google Cloud Console.
    # For Image Generation, ensure the Vertex AI API is enabled and the specific model
    # (gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation) is accessible with your API key.

    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE
    CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID_HERE

    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID_HERE
    ```

    *   Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE` with your API key from Google Cloud Console.
    *   Replace `YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID_HERE` with your Custom Search Engine ID (CX ID). You can create one at the [Programmable Search Engine control panel](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/).

4.  **Run the development server**:
    The application runs on `http://localhost:9002` by default.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **(Optional) Run Genkit Developer UI**:
    To inspect and test your Genkit flows, run the Genkit Developer UI in a separate terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or for watching changes
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This usually starts the Genkit UI on `http://localhost:4000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

The application is divided into intuitive sections to streamline your content and image creation workflow.

### 1. Idea Generation & Research (Optional but Recommended)

*   **Topic Suggester**:
    *   Navigate to the "Topic Suggester" card.
    *   Enter an initial idea or keyword (e.g., "benefits of remote work").
    *   Click "Suggest Topics". AI-generated suggestions will appear.
    *   Click on any suggestion to automatically add it to the "Keywords / Topics" field in the Content Generation section.
*   **Web Search**:
    *   Go to the "Web Search" card.
    *   Enter your search query (e.g., "latest trends in AI marketing").
    *   Click the search icon. Results from Google will be displayed.
    *   Each result includes a title, snippet, and a link to the source. The AI also attempts to extract the main textual content from each URL.
    *   Expand a search result to view its details and extracted content.
    *   Click "Add to Context" to append the result's title, snippet, and extracted content to the "Additional Context" field for your article.

### 2. Content Generation Setup

Located in the "Content Generation Setup" card:

*   **Keywords / Topics**: Fill this field with comma-separated keywords that define your desired content.
*   **Upload Document (Optional)**:
    *   Click "Choose .txt, .md, .pdf, .xlsx, .xls..." to upload a file.
    *   Supported formats: .txt, .md, .pdf, .xlsx, .xls.
    *   The extracted text will be prioritized by the AI as primary reference material.
*   **Additional Context (Optional)**: Provide extra notes, a detailed description, or paste relevant snippets (e.g., from web search results) here.
*   **Content Type**: Specify the type of content (e.g., "informative blog post," "technical summary," "persuasive email," "short poem").
*   **Output Format**: Choose between "Plain Text", "Markdown", or "HTML" (default: HTML).
*   **Output Language**: Select the target language (default: Vietnamese).
*   **Number of Images (0-5)**: Specify how many AI-generated images you want embedded within the article. The AI will determine suitable locations and generate relevant images.

### 3. Generate & Refine Article

*   Once all relevant fields are configured, click the "Generate Article" button.
*   The AI will process your inputs. An activity indicator will show progress.
*   The generated article will appear in the "Generated Article" section.
    *   For **Plain Text**: The content is displayed in an editable textarea.
    *   For **Markdown/HTML**: The content is rendered visually. You can toggle to "View Raw" to see the source code.
*   **Article Actions**:
    *   **View Article**: Opens a modal for a focused view of the article with adjustable font sizes (S, M, L, XL, XXL).
    *   **Copy Article**: Copies the article content. For HTML/Markdown, it copies the raw source. For Plain Text, it copies the text.
    *   **Download Article**: Downloads the article in the selected format (.txt, .md, .html).

### 4. Standalone Image Generation (Functionality present in code, UI may vary)

*   If there's a dedicated "Image Generation" section (as per project structure):
    *   Enter a descriptive prompt for the image (e.g., "a serene landscape with a futuristic city in the background").
    *   Click "Generate Image".
    *   The AI-generated image will be displayed.

## ‚ú® Genkit - The AI Engine

This project leverages **Genkit**, Google's open-source framework, to build and manage AI-powered features. Genkit orchestrates calls to Google's Gemini AI models for various tasks. Key flows include:

*   **`suggest-topics.ts`**: Takes a user's initial idea and suggests related topics or keywords using an LLM.
*   **`google-search.ts`**:
    *   Performs a Google Custom Search using the provided API key and CX ID.
    *   For each search result URL, it fetches the HTML content.
    *   Calls the `extract-html-content.ts` flow to derive the main text.
*   **`extract-html-content.ts`**: Uses an LLM to analyze raw HTML and extract the main textual article, stripping away boilerplate like navigation, ads, and footers.
*   **`generate-article-flow.ts`**:
    *   The core content generation logic.
    *   Accepts keywords, content type, language, output format, number of images, and optional context (uploaded document text, additional notes).
    *   Constructs a detailed prompt for the Gemini model (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`).
    *   If images are requested, it instructs the LLM to:
        1.  Generate the article text with placeholders (e.g., `{{IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_0}}`).
        2.  Suggest image prompts for each placeholder.
    *   It then calls the `generate-image.ts` flow for each suggested prompt and replaces placeholders with the actual image data (as data URIs) formatted according to the chosen output format.
*   **`generate-image.ts`**:
    *   Generates an image from a textual prompt using the `gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation` model.
    *   Includes instructions to the AI to avoid generating text within the images.
    *   Configured with safety settings to allow a broader range of content generation.
    *   Returns the image as a data URI.

All Genkit flows are defined in the `src/ai/flows/` directory and are initialized in `src/ai/genkit.ts`. You can inspect and test these flows using the Genkit Developer UI (`npm run genkit:dev`).

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

*   **Streaming Output for Articles**: Re-introduce streaming for generated articles to enhance user experience for longer content (previously prototyped, needs robust implementation).
*   **Advanced Image Control**: Allow options like aspect ratio, style guidance, or negative prompts for image generation.
*   **User Accounts & History**: Implement user authentication to save generated content, images, and preferences.
*   **Sophisticated Context Management**: Allow users to select specific parts of search results or uploaded documents to include, rather than entire texts.
*   **Tone & Style Customization**: Provide explicit options to specify the tone (e.g., formal, casual, humorous) or writing style of the generated content.
*   **Enhanced Error Handling & Retries**: More robust error handling for API calls and content generation, potentially with user-friendly retry mechanisms.
*   **Content Templates**: Offer pre-defined templates for common content types (e.g., social media posts, ad copy).
*   **Plagiarism Checker Integration**: Option to check generated content for originality.
